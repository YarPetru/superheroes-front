## Briefly about the App

### IMPORTANT

This is Front-end part of application. To get all the features of the app please use the
[backend part of the link](https://github.com/YarPetru/superheroes-back)

The application allows you to work with Superheroes data using CRUD operations of the superhero
model.

### HomePage

When the app starts, 5 superheroes are displayed, buttons to switch between pages and a button to
add a hero. Pagination is implemented with 5 items per page.

As for the images аt this point it is possible to savе, remove and change images of a superhero as a
url. To delete a picture or create a superhero without a picture, simply leave the relevant form
field blank. For superheroes without an added image, the default image will automatically be shown.

Also on this page you can immediately delete a Superhero. When you hover over the card, you will see
a bin button.

Clicking on "i" will take you to the DetailsPage

### DetailsPage

Here you can also open the superhero edit form.

If an item of information is missing in the database, it will not appear on the card to avoid
displaying blank fields

To return to the HomePage, click on the title in the header.
